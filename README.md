 ## Main Idea
 ### Challenge: 
Due to the __dynamic nature__ of news, annotated samples may become __outdated__ quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain __fresh and
high-quality labeled samples__ is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection.

### Solution: 
We propose a reinforced weaklysupervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND,
which can __leverage usersâ€™ reports as weak supervision__ to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection.

## Experiment
We aim to answer two important questions:
  * Does the distribution of news change with time?
  * why should we use the reports to annotate the fake
news?
